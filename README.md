- **XGBoost Model:** 68% accuracy predicting significant moves
- **Bayesian Analysis:** 70.6% success rate for volume spike signals (+38.9% lift)
- **Statistical Volatility Modeling:** Volatility bursts end within statistically optimal timeframes, extreme events cluster, breakouts lose momentum â†’ take profits at derived intervals

## Project Steps

### Data Collection
Retrieved 1 day OHLCV data for Solana (SOL/USDT) over the past 365 days using the Binance API

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Engineered features: returns, volatility, regime labels, technical indicators

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Return Distribution:**
```bash 
Daily mean return: +0.14%
Volatility: 4.58%
Sharpe (daily): 0.03, Sharpe (annualized): 0.60
Skewness: 0.44 (right-skewed), Kurtosis: 3.78 (fat tails)
```
Return distribution has fat tails â†’ standard models underestimate risk   
Volatility clusters over time â†’ regime-aware strategies needed

Calculated daily returns:    
   
![Correlation Return](images/correlation_return.png)   

![Return histogram, Q-Q plot, Box plot, Volatility clusters](images/return_distribution.png)    

**Key insights:**
- Deviation from normal distribution at extremes confirms fat-tail behavior
- Standard risk models will consistently underestimate actual risk exposure
- Numerous outliers beyond typical range, both positive and negative
- Low volatility periods followed by high volatility spikes
- High volatility periods cluster together
- Quiet phases (LOW_VOL_THRESHOLD) alternating with turbulent periods (HIGH_VOL_THRESHOLD)
- Volatility forecasting models could be highly valuable

**Strategic Implications:**
- Dynamic position sizing based on current volatility regime
- Volatility based strategy: vol (<LOW_VOL_THRESHOLD): bigger positions, vol(>HIGH_VOL_THRESHOLD): smaller positions
- Trading vol breakouts from <BREAKOUT_LOW> to >BREAKOUT_HIGH after that bigger movements tend to follow
- Contrarian position after EXTREME_MOVE_THRESHOLD

- No breakout exceeds maximum sustainable period
â†’ Set time-based take-profit at derived intervals
â†’ Take profits early in breakouts based on statistical analysis
      

   
   

**Regime Aware Signal Filtering**
   
To enhance signal robustness and avoid misleading entries in unstable market conditions, I extended the Bayesian indicator analysis by incorporating volatility regime awareness.

The dataset was segmented into three volatility regimes (low, medium, high) using statistically derived thresholds based on rolling volatility metrics.
For each regime, conditional probabilities and signal performance metrics were recalculated.

**Findings On Certain Signals:**

- Strong directional reliability only in specific volatility environments  

- Become unreliable or even contrarian in others   

Based on these findings:

-> Regime-specific signal filtering   

-> Volatility-aware position sizing   

-> Dynamic trade frequency adaptation   

Strategic Impact:
- Probabilistic regime-layering led to a significant performance improvement, with higher Sharpe ratio, reduced drawdown, and increased win rate    

- Instead of using fixed logic, the strategy adapts to market conditions by weighting signals based on contextual statistical strength   


Note: Due to the proprietary nature of this approach, specific signal-regime relationships are not disclosed.




            
## Machine Learning XGBoost Strategies
Predicted whether next day return exceeds threshold:

```python
y = (df['return'] > RETURN_THRESHOLD).astype(int)
```
   
![Confusion Matrix](images/confusion_matrix_xgboost.png)    
  
```bash 
Results:
Accuracy: 68.1%
Precision: 73.1%
Recall: 54.3%
F1 Score: 62.3%
```


![Accuracy](images/accuracy_xgboost.png)    
  


Used SHAP values for feature selection and interpretability.  
![Beeswarm Plot](images/beeswarm_xgboost.png)   


### Simple Strategy Based on XGBoost Insights
```bash Final Capital:** $11,899.60    
Total Return: 19.00%     
Long Signals: 15 | Exit Signals: 232     
Sharpe Ratio: 0.88    
Annualized Volatility: 22.96%    
Max Drawdown: -9.35% 
```  

The XGBoost-based long-only strategy yielded a 19.00% return over the 12-month period, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.88 and a maximum drawdown of -9.35%. Only 15 long entries were triggered, indicating low trading frequency. No transaction costs or slippage were included.

### Regime Aware Strategy with Backtest on XGBoost
```bash 
Return: +19.95%
Sharpe Ratio: 3.27
Max Drawdown: -9.83%
Trades: 9
Win Rate: 55.6%
Avg Return per Trade: +2.30%
```

Signals: 15 entries identified, 232 exit signals processed. Indicators used: vol_regime, prediction_proba, rsi, breakout_high_7d. Fixed Position Sizing (POSITION_SIZE per trade)

### Volatility-Regime-Based Position Sizing
```bash 
Return: +20.03%
Sharpe Ratio: 3.21
Max Drawdown: -7.71%
Trades: 9
Win Rate: 66.7%
Avg Return per Trade: +2.45%
```

Volatility-adjusted sizing led to slightly better risk-adjusted performance and lower drawdown.

High conviction signals paired with regime awareness showed promising trade-offs.
