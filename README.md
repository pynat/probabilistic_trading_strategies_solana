# Solana Trading Strategy: Statistical and Machine Learning Approach
 

## Overview
This project is about statistical anlysis and trading strategies for the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL). It includes data acquisition, creating new features, statistical analysis, probability modeling, feature engineering, and the development of rule-based and machine learning-based trading strategies.     
I fitted different probability distributions (Normal, Exponential, Gamma, Weibull, Poisson) and Bayes to daily return data.

The goal is to explore the dynamics of daily SOL price movements and to build strategies.  

Best found Strategy:

```bash
Initial Capital: $10,000
Final Value: $17,918
Total Return: 79.2%
Number of Trades: 15
Win Rate: 86.7%
Avg Return per Trade: 4.04%
Annualized Volatility: 21.8%
Max Drawdown: -2.9%
Sharpe Ratio: 3.54
```

# Project Steps
   
### Data Collection

* Retrieved 1 day OHLCV data for Solana (SOL/USDT) over the past 365 days using the Binance API   

* Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 

* Feature Engineering


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```bash
Mean return: 0.14
Median return: 0.04
Volatility: 4.58
Skewness: 0.44
Kurtosis: 3.78
Daily Sharpe: 0.03
Annual Sharpe: 0.60

Q1 (25%): -2.52
Q3 (75%): 2.63
VaR 95%: -6.70%
VaR 99%: -8.93%
```
* SOL shows positive expected returns (0.14% daily) but with high volatility (4.58%)
* Distribution is right-skewed with fat tails, more extreme moves
* Significant downside risk: 5% chance of losing >6.7% in a single day
* Decent risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe 0.60) 
* Strong outliers

Calculated daily returns: 
![Correlation Return](images/correlation_return.png)

![Return Distribution](images/return_distribution.png)

Key insights:    

* Returns show normal distribution in the center but with significant fat tails 
* Extreme price movements occur much more frequently than normal distribution would predict

* Q-Q Plot: 
* Deviation from the red line at extremes confirms fat-tail behavior
* Standard risk models will consistently underestimate actual risk exposure

* Box Plot: 
* Numerous outliers beyond typical range, both positive and negative

* Volatility Clustering: 
* Low volatility periods followed by high volatility spikes, particularly visible in early 2025
* High volatility periods cluster together
* Quiet phases (3-4%) alternating with turbulent periods (up to 9%)
* Volatility forecasting models could be highly valuable

* Strategic Implications:

* Dynamic position sizing based on current volatility regime
* Volatility based strategy, vol (<3%): bigger positions, vol(>6%): smaller positions
* Trading vol breakouts from <3% to >5% after that bigger movements tend to follow
* Contrarian position after 8% move

### Bayes Indicator Analysis

* Calculates p(up|signal) vs baseline probability for binary trading indicators
* Performance metrics: calculactes lift percentage, signal frequency, and statistical significance for each indicator

* heatmaps for probability, lift %, and frequency vs performance scatter plots

![Bayes](images/bayes.png)

* signal combinations: tests combinations of best performing bullish/bearish indicators
* trading signal generation: filters significant indicators based on minimum lift and frequency thresholds

```bash
=== BAYES ANALYSIS FOR ALL INDICATORS ===

```

* Findings:
* Indicators are predominantly BEARISH, most signal market weakness 
* Volume spike: 70.6% up probability (+38.9% lift), occurs 4.7% of time -> strong bullish indicator when unusual volume
* Extreme down: 60% success rate (+18% lift) -> could be weighted heavier in strategy but very rare
* Volume expansion: 44.4% up probability (-12.6% lift), occurs 7.5% of time -> expanding volume without direction is bearish
* Extreme up: 44.4% up probability (-12.6% lift), occurs 2.5% of time -> overbought conditions lead to pullbacks
